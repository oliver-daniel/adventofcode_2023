Welcome to my solutions to the 2023 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming challenge. I have no shame in saying that this is something I wait all year to write, and it is perennially a highlight of my programming practice.

I usually write my solutions in Python -- though, if you look at my code, that sometimes seems like a generous definition of the word "Python". It's sometimes a little bit [write-only](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-only_language), as I'm often more invested in getting the solution quickly than writing something more maintainable. If you're a coworker or employer of mine and you're reading this... let's consider this where I go to get my 'bad code' impulses out üòÅ

I sometimes blog about my solutions; if I do so this year, I'll link to my blog here.
